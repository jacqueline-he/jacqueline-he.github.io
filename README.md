Since you've made it in here, I have some extra fun facts about me:
* My family also call me Jackie because when I was in preschool, I couldn't pronounce / write my full name. Friends and teachers picked up on it and the nickname would eventually follow me into college. I don't have a preference and nowadays respond to both names! 
* My favorite books in 2022 (so far): *World War Z* (Max Brooks), *My Year of Rest and Relaxation* (Ottessa Moshfegh), *Minor Feelings* (Cathy Park Hong)
* I collect vintage tamagotchis! The most recent addition to my collection is the 20th Anniversary M!X. I am always hunting for a good deal on the Keitai Kaitsu in Melon Soda.
