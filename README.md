Since you've made it in here, I have some extra fun facts about me:
* I was born on Thanksgiving Day in 2000 (best year of my life).  
* My favorite books in 2022 (so far): *World War Z* (Max Brooks), *My Year of Rest and Relaxation* (Ottessa Moshfegh), *Minor Feelings* (Cathy Park Hong).
* I collect vintage tamagotchis! The most recent addition to my collection is the 20th Anniversary M!X. I am always hunting for a good deal on the Keitai Kaitsu in Melon Soda.
